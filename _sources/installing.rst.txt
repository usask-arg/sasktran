Installing SASKTRAN
*******************
SASKTRAN is designed to work with the Anaconda scientific Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), but it may work with your system Python distribution as long as the necessary dependencies are also available.
Currently we support Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Windows and Linux x64 environments.
Mac wheels for x86_64 are also built for the same Python versions, but support is considered experimental and problems are known to exist.
Mac ARM builds are planned, but not currently available.

Installing SASKTRAN is as simple as::

   pip install sasktran

This will install this package as well as the C++ code.
