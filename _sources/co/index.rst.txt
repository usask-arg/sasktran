SASKTRAN-CO
===========
SASKTRAN "Co"nsoldiated is a new engine in active development, therefore things are subject to change rapidly from
version to version. The goal is to combine the functionality of the HR, DO, TIR, and OCC into a single engine, making
the engine suitable for most atmospheric applications.  It is possible that CO will eventually replace all of these engines and
become the default recommended SASKTRAN engine, however this is likely years in the future.
