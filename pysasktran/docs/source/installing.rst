Installing SASKTRAN
*******************
SASKTRAN is designed to work with the Anaconda scientific Python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
Currently we support Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 on Windows and Linux x64 environments.

Installing SASKTRAN is as simple as::

   pip install sasktran -f https://arg.usask.ca/wheels/

This will install this package as well as the C++ code for SASKTRAN HR.
