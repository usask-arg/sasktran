OSIRIS_ECMWF (DEPRECATED)
=========================
A climatology class that provides the background atmospheric state used in Odin-OSIRIS retrievals. 
The atmospheric state parameters are derived from the ECMWF climatology interpolated to individual OSIRIS scan. 
The advantage of the class is that a much smaller file size can store the ECMWF information for one scan and 
it is much quicker to read in the small file than the entire ECMWF climatology.

..  note::

    This climatology is no longer part of Sasktran Core components. It is now installed as part of the OSIRIS
    Level 1 Services.

The class only considers mjd when updating the cache and completely ignores any latitude and longitude parameters 
provided by the user. The class is very useful for providing the atmospheric state of OSIRIS scans 
but has limited value outside this purpose::

   import sasktranif as skif

   mjd = 52393.3792987115
   lat = 0.0
   lng = 0.0
   height = 25000.0
   location = [lat,lng,height,mjd]
   climate = skif.ISKClimatology('OSIRIS_ECMWF')
   climate.UpdateCache( location )
   ok1, air = climate.GetParameter( 'SKCLIMATOLOGY_AIRNUMBERDENSITY_CM3', location);
   ok2, P   = climate.GetParameter( 'SKCLIMATOLOGY_PRESSURE_PA',          location);
   ok3, T   = climate.GetParameter( 'SKCLIMATOLOGY_TEMPERATURE_K',        location);
